# metaphors
Springboard Capstone Project (NLP/NLU)

It is all about the cognitive leap: what does it mean to *suddenly understand* something and how humans connect the dots. 
When I learn new things (a new for me field of knowledge) I examine it as follows:

* What is it about? – Of course, *in relations* to things I know
* What is it like? – Is it *similar in structure* and/or behavior to things I know
* How is it different? – How is it *special*, what are its own laws and structures

And so metaphors appear to me as an extremely helpful tool for step 2: grasping certain features of a new domain in terms a well-known domain. 

The purpose of this research is creating a model trained on large corpus of structurally rich data (I start with Wikipedia), which *gets input like “having an argument” and produces an output “is like fighting a battle”*. The result will be based on similarities in the domains' structure (dependencies) and behavior of their subjects (verbs).
